        directions='''Now it's time to add the herbs.

This means add the galangal, lemongrass, tomato, chili, shallot, garlic, coriander, makrut leaf, and lime. This is the flavour of tom yum!

All you have to do is slice or smash everything to help release the flavours and so you can jam it into the bottle. I used my wooden pestle like a club, but you can use the side of a heavy knife, or karate.

Galangal - This is a root in the ginger family that smells amazing. In Thailand we use it in everything! If you can't find it fresh, DON'T use ginger because it will taste too weird. You can find dried galangal online and soak it in hot water to make it like new again!

Makrut lime leaf - This is also called kaffir lime leaf and you can usually find it frozen or dried. Frozen is better. Tear the leaf up to release its incredible scent!

Lemongrass - You can just use the softer, paler low part of the stem for a milder tste, or the leaves as well for something much stronger.

Shallot - I roasted my shallot over a burner first then peeled it and sliced it up. This gave the drink a slight smoky flavour, but it also tastes good raw.

Chilis - Put in as many as you want. One or two goes a long way, but it depends how hot you like it!

        stepTitle="Add the Vodka and Wait...",
        directions='''...but not long.

Go ahead and pour the vodka into the bigger bottle, or back from your pitcher into the original bottle, whichever you used.

Now put it in a dark place so that light doesn't dull the colours or the flavour.

You'll be surprised - after just one day your tom yum vodka will taste and especially smell great!

When it's ready, you can keep it in the refrigerator in this bottle with all the herbs inside because they are so pretty. Or you can pour just the alcohol back into the original vodka bottle and it will last a lot longer.

I think you can sip this vodka all on its own, but you can also mix it to make drinks like the best bloody mary ever.

It looks great when you serve it to your friends with all the herbs still inside, especially with some Thai food.

Thanks and I hope you enjoy my recipe!

Modeling chocolate is easier to sculpt as well, however, it does warm faster. I used this recipe for my toad cake instructable, so I know it works.

Supplies:

2 cups corn syrup
10 cups (454 grams) chocolate almond bark (light and dark chocolate)
*DOUBLE THE RECIPE*

I used Liz's recipe here: https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/modeling-chocola...

Steps:

Put the stove top on medium heat.
Melt the chocolate until it's smooth.
Add the corn syrup slowly when the chocolate is still hot, then stir it in until it resembles the consistency of unpulled taffy.
Dump the mixture onto some plastic wrap, spread it out, then seal it and place it in the fridge.
Cool overnight. Repeat for white and dark chocolate modeling chocolate.
Suggestions:

Make more modeling chocolate than you think you'll need! I doubled the recipe, and I still think I could have used a little more white modeling chocolate. And if you make too much, you can always freeze it for future projects.
If you're making an Instructable, don't forget to take pictures of your modeling chocolate like I did. :( Maybe you'll get lucky and already have some pictures on hand, but always double-check before moving to your next step!''')

Keep the lid on for 3-4 minutes and ensure all the sugar granules are dissolved.
Remove the lid, insert a candy thermometer carefully and continue cooking on medium-high until the syrup reaches 240° F.
When the sugar solution is at about 235° F, begin whipping the egg whites on high speed.
Add the salt to the egg whites.
When the egg whites reach soft peaks, pour the sugar solution in a steady stream on to the whipping whites while mixing on low speed. Be careful, the sugar is still extremely hot!
Continue whipping the egg/sugar mixture until it reaches stiff peaks. (Liz wraps an apron around the bowl with an ice pack to help the meringue cool down faster.)
Once the meringue is cooled, whip in soft butter and vanilla until the buttercream is light and fluffy and no longer has a butter taste. This can take from 10-15 minutes.
We thought caramel would be a good flavor to complement the vanilla flavor and gold coloring. Add a tablespoon of caramel syrup, then mix. Taste it, and add if you'd like. Add a little at a time so you don't wreck the frosting.
Add yellow and orange food coloring to achieve a light gold color.''')

If your cake is in one pan, cut it in half so you have two pieces. Trim it so it fits comfortably onto your cake board. *KEEP THE CAKE SCRAPS, YOU WILL NEED THEM LATER* If you want to, add simple syrup to your cakes and wait for it to soak in.
Slap a good amount of frosting onto one of your cake pieces. Not too much, unless you like frosting more than cake.
Place your other cake piece on top of your frosting layer.
Add a large amount of frosting ontop of your cake, then cover the entire cake in a thin layer of frosting. Insert into the fridge to chill overnight or for at least 3 hours.
Lightly draw a semi-circle towards the top of the cake. This is where No-Face will be sitting later. Cut a thin layer away so the circle is lower than the rest of the cake.
Draw a larger semi-circle, then carve the sides so they're rounded.
Add cake scraps to the side of the larger circle, starting with larger pieces on the bottom, and ending with smaller pieces on top.
Carve so the circles begin to resemble a bathtub. It doesn't have to be perfect, we'll be covering it in modeling chocolate later.
To make the bathtub appear taller, trim away a thin layer of the rest of the cake (where the food will be sitting).

Shape the cake dough into a blob-ish shape. The top should be thinner than the bottom. It's okay if it doesn't look beautiful, as No-Face is bumpy and blobby in the movie.
Roll a medium sheet of black-tinted dark chocolate modeling chocolate. Drape it over your cake pop blob, and smooth it gently. To add his hair, cut some brown modeling chocolate into spikes and add it to the top.
Roll a small ball of fondant, and squish it into an oval.
Use vodka and food coloring to paint his face. If you screw up, use more vodka to wipe the food coloring away.
Use a little buttercream to adhere his dried face to the cake pop blob.
Wrap two toothpicks in dark modeling chocolate.
Sculpt two tiny, outstretched hands. They don't have to look great, he is a spirit afterall.

And we're finished. Thank you for reading through this Instructable, I had a fun time making it AND the cake! If you want to make the cake even crazier, sculpt the frog-workers or add little hands inbetween the food. If I'm being honest though, I'm not expecting too many people to make this as a cake. However, cupcakes would be a fantastic idea, and much easier to execute. If you want to take the plunge though, all power to you! I won't give you any gold though.

I read everything I could find about what makes a chocolate chip cookie truly outstanding, and gained the most insight from the experiment that inspired this one, performed by David Leite for the New York Times in July of 2008. Our results, however, differed, though the few secrets revealed in the article remain invaluable.

The key secret in making amazing chocolate chip cookies seems to be in how long you let the dough sit before baking. Even Mrs. Wakefield employed this technique when she invented the original Nestle Toll House recipe - it just didn't make it onto the package!

Leaving the dough in the fridge for 24-36 hours allows the ingredients to fully soak up the liquid, and result in a firmer dough which bakes to a better consistency.

A long hydration time is important because eggs, unlike, say, water, are gelatinous and slow-moving. And since butter coats the flour, it makes it difficult for the liquids to get through to the dry ingredients.

Another hint is to rotate the cookie sheet mid-way through baking. This allows your cookies to bake evenly, regardless of where the hottest part of your oven is. This simple trick was a game-changer for me, and I'll never do otherwise again!

The NYTimes article suggests there's no substitute for a 6" cookie whose dough has been left in the fridge for at least 36 hours. But after this experiment, I care to differ.''')

            Slice a loaf of French bread on a diagonal for bite sized toasts.

            Brush each side of the bread with olive oil.

            The olive oil adds flavor and helps the bread look beautiful after toasting!

            Toast the bread on your grill over High heat.

            Do your toasting with the lid up and pay attention! It is easy to go from "beautifully toasted" to "burnt to a crisp".

            Depending upon your grill you will need to toast for about three minutes per side.

            You could also do this in the oven using the broiler. You know...just in case it's raining or something :)

            Remove the toasted bread from the grill.

            Spread a layer of the fresh guacamole onto the toast.

            Pile the fresh bruschetta on top of the guacamole.

            I don’t know how to quantitatively measure the spiciness of each of the gummies I made using the different peppers. So, I’ll just let you know how many peppers I put per cup of water and I’ll try to describe the spice level.

            2 Habaneros, 1 cup Water: (mixed with Orange Kool-Aid) Spiciest of the three. Has a bite to it, but doesn’t set your mouth on fire. Wouldn’t want to pop a whole one into my mouth, but if I did it wouldn’t be terrible. Best enjoyed squirrel-style, (in tiny bites over a longer period of time). Could eat more than one but would rather have something less spicy.

            1 Jalapeno, 1 cup Water: (mixed with Green Apple Kool-Aid) Moderately spicy. Just enough spice it give it a kick. The heat isn’t overpowering and doesn’t distract from the overall flavor of the gummy. Green Apple Kool-Aid adds a sour taste which made this gummy sweet, sour and spicy. Strange, yet tasty.

            5 Dried Japanese Chili Peppers, 1 cup Water: (mixed with Cherry Kool-Aid) Spice is barely noticeable, would feed these to a child.

            Time: about 10 minutes

            - Lightly oil the pan and put it on medium heat until it's warm (don't overheat or the oil will start to splatter).
            - Place 10 gyozas in the pan next to each other. The gyozas should sizzle a bit as you place them in the pan.
            - When the gyozas' bottoms form a slight, golden brown coating, pour enough water until it's about 1/2 inch deep. Then cover the pan with the lid and open once in a while to let the steam out.
            - When almost all of the water is gone, use the spatula to "work" the sticky gyozas off the pan. The bottom of the gyozas should be covered in more brown spots but are still crispy. Try to keep them together!

            TIPS
            - Sprinkle some water on the "pasty white" portions of the gyoza wrappers. This will help make the gyozas more presentable when they're done cooking.
            - Can't finish all 50 gyozas? You can put the uncooked gyozas in the freezer until you need them. Then just defrost them and cook them as you would normally! (It's OK if they're stuck together.)

Then with a butter knife lightly run in along the pan in one direction then perpendicular at 90 degrees to 'cross-hatch' the ice cream. this helps to make it even and remove any air bubbles.  Then repeat the same piping and knife technique with the rest of the colours in the order of blue, green, yellow and red. ** You will see that the amount of ice cream and the thickness of brownies is made exactly for this pan. if you make your brownies too thick the ice cream may overflow out f the pan.  Then add the top layer of brownie on top of the ice cream roughly in the middle over the brownie base to line them up to top off the sandwich.  Then cover with glad wrap and place into the freezer for a minimum of 8 hours (i typically leave in the freezer over night or the day before i need them)")

Transfer to the large bowl and drizzle a generous amount of oil and a good sprinkling of salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix everything up and ensure all the potatoes are covered in oil.  Spread the fries over the two baking trays, making sure to leave space between each one for maximum crispiness.  Bake in the oven for 25-35 minutes or until golden and crunchy. Don't forget to take them out about halfway through to flip as this ensures even browning of the fries.  Before serving, toss the fries in more salt or any other seasonings of choice.")

The first impression is that you are stuffing, well, plastic in your mouth, and the plastic can have a very slight salty flavor from the agar, but as soon as you start chewing, the plastic disappears, and you get all the goodness from the trail mix. If you really think about it, the edible plastic adds a slight, chewy gummy-bear texture in the background, but it goes perfectly with the dried fruit.  Durability: The plastic holds up pretty well to scrunching, even though it may rip in areas that are very thin. However, the seams are a bit fragile and can easily open so that trail mix falls out. Also, the plastic is sensitive to humidity. So I probably wouldn't stuff these goodie bags in the kids' pockets if I knew they were going to play in the rain or stick their hands in the pocket a thousand times to feel if the treat is still there (even though I think I might actually slip one of these in my own pocket, hmmm, but for the kids, maybe put it as a surprise in the sack lunch for school). I think the best way to store and carry these plastic pockets with trail mix would be in a real food-grade plastic bag or container.  I hope you liked this instructable!

Once chicken is cook through add diced onions and green peppers.  Cover and let the onions and green soften. Add about a 1/4 cup of water to the skillet. Now time to add your spices(Cumin, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, salt, pepper, etc)…I can’t tell you exact amounts to add of each, but you be the judge.  Add the spices I listed in the ingredients section at your discretion (Add this point if you like spicy foods then add you favorite hot sauce to the chicken). Lower the heat and let simmer until use.

## Ingestibles at a Glance

### Home Page & All Recipes Page
On home page, users can peruse through different recipes, which are grouped by tags/categories.

Users can view all recipes by either clicking on the "Recipes" button in the nav bar or clicking on the user profile dropdown and clicking "All Recipes."  Once on this page, user can see all the recipes ordered by date of post starting with the most recent.

### Recipes
Logged-in users can create recipes, edit and delete their own recipes. As each recipe would have customized number and content of ingredients, steps and tags, a dynamic recipe creation form and a pre-filled recipe edit form will capture the difference and allow customization.

##### Edit Recipe:

## Technologies used
* Python
* Flask
* PostgreSQL
* SQLAlchemy
* HTML
* Vanilla CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Redux
* AWS S3

The Virtual DOM in React allows dynamic and interactive components. The following code is used to dynamically display tags and manage their states per change of input, in the pre-filled recipe edit form. 

##### Dynamically displaying tags at Recipe Edit Form
```jsx
{[...Array(tagCounter)].map((el, i) => (<div className='createRecipeEl' key={`tag${i + 1}`}>
                        <label className='editRecipeLabel'>Tag #{i + 1} </label>
                        <input
                            className='listingInput'
                            type="text"
                            defaultValue={tags[`tag${i+1}`]}
                            onChange={(e) => {
                                setTags(tags=>{
                                tags[`tag${i+1}`] = e.target.value
                                return tags
                                })
                            }}
                            placeholder='At least 1 Tag'
                        />
                    </div>))}
```
